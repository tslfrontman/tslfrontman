- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tslfrontman, a board game developer from Vancouver. Some of my games include Crystal Quest, Race to First, Kickstart My Cart, Cloudpuncher, Lost in the Dark, and Revenge: the Movie. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating, advancing, and improving the standards of tabletop gaming and particularly RPG spaces as a whole. My games' baselines include 'accessible and efficient rules'. 
Typically, either combining multiple "types of fun" and physical gameplay elements, or in simple and singular "one-page-rules" games.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a basic choose-your-own-adventure script, making human-sourced card images and assets, dice maths, TTRPG convention rules, and the 9000+ things involved in how to efficiently produce a board game.
